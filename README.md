## Known Issues and Pending Tasks

1. **Lack of Backend Developer**: Limits our ability to complete most pages due to the inability to implement APIs or test functionality.
2. **No Backend Data**: Currently no data available for testing or development purposes.
3. **User Flow Deficiencies**: Lack of cohesive user flow makes it challenging to route and link pages together.
4. **Frequent Design Changes**: Numerous design changes have made it difficult to track modifications consistently.
5. **Incomplete Pages**: Several pages are incomplete, making it impractical to start or modify them without clear specifications.
6. **Implementation Challenges**: Difficulties in determining the best method for implementing certain features.
7. **Impractical Features**: Some proposed technologies are impractical given current constraints.
8. **Responsive UI Issues**: Certain UI elements do not render correctly on mobile devices.

## Suggested Solutions for Improvement

1. Hire or allocate a backend developer to facilitate API integration.
2. Establish a mock data service or utilize sample datasets for front-end development.
3. Develop a comprehensive user flow diagram outlining navigation paths between pages.
4. Implement a version control system for design assets with a clear approval process.
5. Prioritize completion of incomplete pages by defining specifications and assigning resources.
6. Conduct collaborative brainstorming sessions to explore viable implementation strategies.
7. Reassess feature feasibility based on available technologies.
